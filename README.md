# HLSL Class Generator

HLSL Class Generator is a small utility for generating C++ classes for use with DirectX HLSL shaders, producing a ready-to-use C++ class containing the variables and initialization code required to start using a shader from inside a DirectX application. 

This code is very much a work in progress and is a rough version of a utility I've been using for my game engine project. I thought others might find it useful so I've open sourced it here.
